The goal of this repository is to centralize the technical knowledge obtained on the hosting of an Openlink Virtuoso server, using a docker image. The information given comes from the experience of five different projects of the WIMMICS team. Each project had a different use case. This repository aims to cover the functionalities that were common to most of the five projects, for future reference.
